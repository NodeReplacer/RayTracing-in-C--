    //I'm still not sure about OOP and all that encapsulation, inheritance, etc.

    //How fortunate for us that they are simply named after themselves so camera is in camera.h but that's not always
    //the case (rarely the case) in most programs.

    //So I just had an experience that illustrated my problem. I had to go modify my write_color function and now I had to
    //go searching through all my files to remember where it was. Instead of just going here and searching this one file.
    //Good thing my IDE lets me search between files. Just ignore the fact that I would not need that function right now
    //if I never did this encapsulate inheritance thing to begin with.
